      description: 'José Gabriel González (born 31 July 1978) is a Swedish-Ar
  gentinian indie folk singer-songwriter and guitarist from Gothenburg, Swede
  n. González is also a member of the band Junip, along with Tobias Winterkor
  n.The first band he played in was Back Against the Wall, a Gothenburg hardc
  ore punk band influenced by Black Flag, The Misfits and the Dead Kennedys.
  He later played bass guitar in another hardcore band, Renascence, between 1
  993–1998. Between 1997 and 1998 José played guitar with rock band Only if Y
  ou Call Me Jonathan.In June 2003 González released his debut solo release,
  a two-track 7` single. The single was discovered by Joakim Gävert, co-found
  er of the then fledgling label Imperial Records who then signed González as
   their first official artist. In October he released his debut album, Venee
  r, in Europe. The album was subsequently released in the UK on 25 April 200
  5, and in the United States on 6 September 2005. The album was made while G
  onzález was a PhD student at the University of Gothenburg.González` tradema
  rk sound is solo classical guitar with soft vocal melody. His work, althoug
  h mostly original, also includes acoustic covers of such hits as `Heartbeat
  s` by his fellow Swedes The Knife, `Love Will Tear Us Apart` by Joy Divisio
  n, `Born in the U.S.A.` and `The Ghost of Tom Joad` by Bruce Springsteen, `
  Hand on Your Heart` by Kylie Minogue, `Smalltown Boy` by Bronski Beat, `Tea
  rdrop` by Massive Attack and `Last Snowstorm of the Year` by Low.His second
   album, In Our Nature, was released internationally on 22 September 2007. T
  he album`s lyrical content was in part influenced by his reading of books l
  ike The God Delusion by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and Practica
  l Ethics by ethicist Peter Singer. In 2007, González won a European Border
  Breakers Award Award. Every year the European Border Breakers Awards (EBBA)
